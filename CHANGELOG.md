* Simply use `glitch_this args` from the commandline after `pip3 install glitch-this`!
* Add **Glitching an image to GIF support** in the library! Now you can specify the necessary arguments to get a list of frames that you can use to make a GIF as well as normal images!

## Version 0.0.7
* Implement **version checker** in commandline script

  The commandline tool will now inform you if the package is out of date!

* Fix a script breaking bug

## Version 0.0.7.2 - Patch
* Fix missing frames argument

## Version 0.0.8 - **MAJOR**
* Add support for `Image` object input, now you can directly pass an `Image` object to the library!

* Cleanup code

* Add more docs

## Version 0.0.9 - **MAJOR**
* The library will now cleanup after itself when making glitched GIFs

*  NEW Parameters for `commandline.py`:-

  * `-l, --loop`: Specify how many times the GIF should loop

    Defaults to 0, i.e infinite loop

  * `-f, --force`: The script will no longer automatically overwrite existing files, you need to include `-f` for it do so

    Defaults to False

  * `-o, --outfile`: Specify a full/relative path to write the output file to

    check out the [docs](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/wiki) for information on how to use these!

* Add more sanity checks in `commandline.py`

* Reduce compression level from 6 to 3 in `commandline.py` (improves performance significantly)

* `-f,--frames` has been renamed to `-fr, --frames`

## Version 0.0.9.1 - Patch
* Reduce compression level from 6 to 3 `glitch_this.py` (improves performance)

## Version 0.1.0 - **MAJOR**
* Organize argparser help text

* NEW parameters for `glitch_image` and `glitch_gif` in `glitch_this.py`:-
  * `glitch_change`: Increment/Decrement `glitch_amount` by given amount after every glitching

  * `cycle`: Whether or not to cycle `glitch_amount` back to 1 or 10, if it overflows or underflows

  * `step`: Glitch every step'th frame, instead of all of them
* NEW parameters for `commandline.py`:-

  * `-i, --increment`: Increment/Decrement `glitch_amount` by given amount after every glitching

  * `-cy, --cycle`: Whether or not to cycle `glitch_amount` back to 1 or 10, if it overflows or underflows

  * `step`: Glitch every step'th frame, instead of all of them

  * `relative_duration`: Use a duration relative to the source GIFs duration

## Version 0.1.1 - Patch
* Add punctuation to help text

## Version 0.1.2 - Patch
* Fix version name

## Version 0.1.3 - **MAJOR**
* Add support for float type numbers for glitch_amount

  You can now supply floats as glitch_amount! This works best when using floats with maximum of 1-2 decimal places

  Read the [docs](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/wiki) for more info!

* Redesign help text for the commandline script

* Add a more detailed description for the commandline script

* Add more sanity checks in `glitch_this.py`

* Improve Exception handling and Exception messages

## Version 0.1.3.1 - Patch
* Fix help text formatting in `commandline.py`

## Version 0.1.4 - **MAJOR**
* Add support for floats as Increment/Decrement (`glitch_change`)

  You can now use a value between +-0.0 and +-10.0 (inclusive)

* Glitching intensity can now be in range 0.1 to 10.0 (inclusive)

## Version 0.1.5
* Improve version checking efficiency

  The version is only checked once every few days and saved into a local file. This file is checked afterwards. Eliminates the need to send request to pypi

* Add `--version` argument to the commandline script

## Version 1.0.0 - **MAJOR**
* NEW `glitch_image` and `glitch_gif` in `glitch_this.py`:-
  * `seed`: Set a custom seed to be used by `random`, for generating similar images across runs
* NEW parameters for `commandline.py`:-
  * `-sd, --seed`: Set a custom seed to be used by `random`, for generating similar images across runs
* Cleanup the codebase using fstrings
* Add FULL **typing support** for providing a better experience to library users
* Fix undefined variable in `glitch_gif`

## Version 1.0.1
* Add better error message when `frame['duration']` in `glitch_gif` (from `glitch_this.py`) raises a key error
  Suggested by [#32](https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/issues/32)

## Version 1.0.2
* Minor changes related to versioning fixes

  See: https://github.com/TotallyNotChase/glitch-this/pull/33
  *Thanks to @[ghost](https://github.com/ghost)*

## Version 1.0.3
* Add typing overloads for `glitch_image` to choose return type based on `gif: bool` parameter.

  Whether the function returns `Image` or `List[Image]` can be deduced by the type checker based on
  the value of the `gif` parameter (when it is a boolean constant literal)
